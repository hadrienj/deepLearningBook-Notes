    "Dimensions are a crucial topic in data science. The dimensions are all the features of the dataset. For instance, if you are looking at a dataset containing pieces of music, dimensions could be the genre, the length of the piece, the number of instruments, the presence of a singer etc. You can imagine all these dimensions as different columns. When there is only two dimensions, it is very convenient to plot: you can use the $x$- and $y$-axis. Add color and you can represent a third dimension. It is similar if you have tens or hundereds of dimensions, it will just be harder to visualize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have that many dimensions it happens that some of them are correlated. For instance, we can reasonably think that the genre dimension will correlate with the instruments dimensions in our previous example. One way to reduce dimensionality is simply to keep only some of them. The problem is that you loose good information. It would be nice to have a way to reduce these dimensions while keeping all the information present in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of principal components analysis (PCA) is generaly to reduce the number of dimensions of a dataset where dimensions are not completly decorelated. PCA provides us with a new set of dimensions, the principal components (PC). They are ordered: the first PC is the dimension having the largest variance. In addition, each PC is orthogonal to the preceding one. Remember that orthogonal vectors means that their dot product is equal to $0$ (see [2.6](https://hadrienj.github.io/posts/Deep-Learning-Book-Series-2.6-Special-Kinds-of-Matrices-and-Vectors/)). This means that each PC is decorelated to the preceding one. It is way better than feature selection where you loose a lot of information.\n",
